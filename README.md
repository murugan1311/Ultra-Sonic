# Ultra-Sonic
In this project, a Portable Ultrasonic Range Meter is designed which can be used to measure distance of a target in non-contact fashion. The project is based on Arduino, Ultrasonic Sensor and an LCD display.In this technique, a high frequency sound wave is transmitted by a transmitter and the reflected echo from a target is captured by a receiver.
